\section{IPython notebook test}
  
 I'm going to add a little section about the bias-variance tradeoff and the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamesâ€“Stein_estimator}{James-Stein estimator} soon. For now, I'm going to just add a figure with an associated IPython notebook. If you hover over the notebook, you should be able to 'launch ipython' and execute it.
