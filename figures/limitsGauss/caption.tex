Taken from Fig.3 of \cite{2011arXiv1105.3166C}: (a) Upper limits from the PCL (solid), CLs and Bayesian (dashed), and classical (dotted) procedures as a function of $\mu$), which is assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution with unit standard deviation. (b) The corresponding coverage probabilities as a function of $\mu$.
