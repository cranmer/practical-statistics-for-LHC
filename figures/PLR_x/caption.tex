Visualization of a two dimensional likelihood function $-2\ln L(\mu,\theta)$.  The blue line in the plane represents the profiling operation $\hat{\hat{\theta}}(\mu)$ and the blue curve along the likelihood surface represents $-2\ln \lambda(\mu)$.  Note it is was to show that the blue line exits the contours of $-2\ln L(\mu,\theta)$ when they are perpendicular to the $\mu$ axis, which provides the correspondence between the profile likelihood ratio and the description of the \texttt{Minos} algorithm.
