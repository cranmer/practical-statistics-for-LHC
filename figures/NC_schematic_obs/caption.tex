A schematic visualization of the Neyman Construction.  For each value of $\theta$ one finds a region in $x$ that satisfies $\int f(x|\theta) dx$ (blue).  Together these regions form a confidence belt (green).  The intersection of the observation $x_0$ (red) with the confidence belt defines the confidence interval $[\theta_1,\theta_2]$.
