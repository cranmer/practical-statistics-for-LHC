This document is a pedagogical introduction to statistics for particle physics.  
Emphasis is placed on the terminology, concepts, and methods being used at the Large Hadron Collider.  
The document addresses both the statistical tests applied to a model of the data and the modeling itself .
I expect to release updated versions of this document in the future.
