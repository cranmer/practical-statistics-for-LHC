The outcome is a posterior probability density for the spectrum before smearing, defined in the multi-dimensional space of all possible spectra. Regularization consists in choosing a non-constant prior. Despite some similarity, the fully bayesian unfolding (FBU) method, presented here, should not be confused with D'Agostini's iterative method.},

@article{Birnbaum:1962,
	Abstract = {The concept of conditional experimental frames of reference has a significance for the general theory of statistical inference which has been emphasized by R. A. Fisher, D. R. Cox, J. W. Tukey, and others. This concept is formulated as a principle of conditionality, from which some general consequences are deduced mathematically. These include the likelihood principle, which has not hitherto been very widely accepted, in contrast with the conditionality concept which many statisticians are inclined to accept for purposes of "informative inference." The likelihood principle states that the "evidential meaning" of experimental results is characterized fully by the likelihood function, without other reference to the structure of an experiment, in contrast with standard methods in which significance and confidence levels are based on the complete experimental model. The principal writers supporting the likelihood principle have been Fisher and G. A. Barnard, in addition to Bayesian writers for whom it represents the "directly empirical" part of their standpoint. The likelihood principle suggests certain systematic reinterpretations and revisions of standard methods, including "intrinsic significance and confidence levels" and "intrinsic standard errors," which are developed and illustrated. The close relations between non-Bayesian likelihood methods and Bayesian methods are discussed.},

@article{KassWasserman,
	Abstract = {Subjectivism has become the dominant philosophical foundation for Bayesian inference. Yet in practice, most Bayesian analyses are performed with so-called "noninformative" priors, that is, priors constructed by some formal rule. We review the plethora of techniques for constructing such priors and discuss some of the practical and philosophical issues that arise when they are used. We give special emphasis to Jeffreys's rules and discuss the evolution of his viewpoint about the interpretation of priors, away from unique representation of ignorance toward the notion that they should be chosen by convention. We conclude that the problems raised by the research on priors chosen by formal rules are serious and may not be dismissed lightly: When sample sizes are small (relative to the number of parameters being estimated), it is dangerous to put faith in any "default" solution; but when asymptotics take over, Jeffreys's rules and their variants remain reasonable choices. We also provide an annotated bibliography.},
